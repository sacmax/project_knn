# project_knn
In this project, I will use KNN model to predict results on a anonymized dataset.
I will start with k=1 and find the metrics for the model. Later I will find the values of k for which the model gives the minimum error. Chosing the new value for k, I will find the metrics for the model again to check if it improved or not.
